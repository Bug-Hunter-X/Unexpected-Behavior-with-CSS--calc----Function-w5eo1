The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, sometimes unexpected results occur if there are spaces around the operators. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px)` works correctly, but `width: calc( 100% - 20px )` may not.  Another issue arises when using `calc()` with different units.  Mixing units without proper consideration can cause the calculation to fail or produce unexpected results.  For instance,  `height: calc(100px + 20%)` might work inconsistently depending on the context. Finally, nested `calc()` functions can sometimes be difficult to debug and lead to unexpected outcomes.
